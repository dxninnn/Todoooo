Database Schema (Supabase)
The Supabase PostgreSQL database will store tasks efficiently. Below is the schema for the tasks table:

CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  priority TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
  due_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
